    "# An overview of the pandas package\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is a Python package that supports fast, flexible, and expressive data structures, as well as computing functions for data analysis. The following are some prominent features that pandas supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data structure with labeled axes. This makes the program clean and clear and avoids common errors from misaligned data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexible handling of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subset creation of large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Powerful arithmetic operations and statistical computations on a custom axis via axis label.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Robust input and output support for loading or saving data from and to files, databases, or HDF5 format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to pandas installation, we recommend an easy way, that is to install it as a part of Anaconda, a cross-platform distribution for data analysis and scientific computing. You can refer to the [reference]( http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) to download and install the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, we can use it like other Python packages. Firstly, we have to import the following packages at the beginning of the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pandas\n",
    ">>> import pandas as pd\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first get acquainted with two of pandas' primary data structures: the Series and the DataFrame. They can handle the majority of use cases in finance, statistic, social science, and many areas of engineering."

    "# 1. Series\n",
    "\n",
    "A Series is a one-dimensional object similar to an array, list, or column in table. Each item in a Series is assigned to an entry in an index:\n",
    "```pandas\n",
    ">>> s1 = pd.Series(np.random.rand(4), index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])\n",
    ">>> s1\n",
    "a    0.6122\n",
    "b    0.98096\n",
    "c    0.3350\n",
    "d    0.7221\n",
    "dtype: float64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, if no index is passed, it will be created to have values ranging from 0 to N-1, where N is the length of the Series:\n",
    "```pandas\n",
    ">>> s2 = pd.Series(np.random.rand(4))\n",
    ">>> s2\n",
    "0    0.6913\n",

    "3    0.7286\n",
    "dtype: float64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access the value of a Series by using the index:\n",
    "```pandas\n",
    ">>> s1['c']\n",
    "0.3350\n",
    ">>>s1['c'] = 3.14\n",
    ">>> s1['c', 'a', 'b']\n",
    "c    3.14\n",
    "a    0.6122\n",
    "b    0.98096\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This accessing method is similar to a Python dictionary. Therefore, pandas also allows us to initialize a Series object directly from a Python dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pandas\n",
    ">>> s3 = pd.Series({'001': 'Nam', '002': 'Mary', '003': 'Peter'})\n",
    ">>> s3\n",

    "002    Mary\n",
    "003    Peter\n",
    "dtype: object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we want to filter or rename the index of a Series created from a Python dictionary. At such times, we can pass the selected index list directly to the initial function, similarly to the process in the preceding example. Only elements that exist in the index list will be in the Series object. Conversely, indexes that are missing in the dictionary are initialized to default NaN values by pandas:\n",
    "```pandas\n",
    ">>> s4 = pd.Series({'001': 'Nam', '002': 'Mary',\n",
    "                    '003': 'Peter'}, index=[\n",

    ">>> s4\n",
    "002    Mary\n",
    "001    Nam\n",
    "024    NaN\n",
    "065    NaN\n",
    "dtype:   object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The library also supports functions that detect missing data:\n",
    "```pandas\n",
    ">>> pd.isnull(s4)\n",
    "002    False\n",
    "001    False\n",
    "024    True\n",
    "065    True\n",
    "dtype: bool\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can also initialize a Series from a scalar value:\n",
    "```pandas\n",
    ">>> s5 = pd.Series(2.71, index=['x', 'y'])\n",
    ">>> s5\n",
    "x    2.71\n",
    "y    2.71\n",
    "dtype: float64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A Series object can be initialized with NumPy objects as well, such as ndarray. Moreover, pandas can automatically align data indexed in different ways in arithmetic operations:\n",
    "```pandas\n",
    ">>> s6 = pd.Series(np.array([2.71, 3.14]), index=['z', 'y'])\n",
